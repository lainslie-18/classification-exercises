    "b. Recently several stories in the local news have come out highlighting customers who received a rubber duck with a defect, and portraying C3 in a bad light. The PR team has decided to launch a program that gives customers with a defective duck a vacation to Hawaii. They need you to predict which ducks will have defects, but tell you the really don't want to accidentally give out a vacation package when the duck really doesn't have a defect. Which evaluation metric would be appropriate here? Which model would be the best fit for this use case?"
